# Statistical-analysis-of-stochastic-processes

### GUI-based tool that allows a user to enter any stochastic process and results in the ensemble and the time statistics of such process.
---
## GUI Description
#### The GUI do the following:
1) Allow the user enter a random process in the form of the ensemble, i.e. all the sample functions,
each defined by two vectors; time and amplitude. Note that the time vector can be common to all
the sample functions.
An example .m file of the ensemble is attached.
2) Give the use to perform and display the following:
- Plot M sample functions of the ensemble of the process, where M is entered by the user
- Calculate and plot the ensemble mean of the process
- Calculates the time mean of the nth sample function of the process, where n is entered by the user
- Calculate and plot the statistical auto-correlation function between the ith sample and the jth sample of the process, where i and j are entered by the user
- Calculate the time auto-correlation function of the nth sample function of the process, where n is entered by the user
- Calculate and plot the power spectral density of the process
- Calculate the total average power of the process
